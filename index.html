          School Districts Most In Need of Educational Intervention to Catch Students up in a Post-Pandemic Learning Environment
        </p>
        <p class="intro__text">
          The Urban Institute houses a dataset, "Household Conditions by
          Geographic School District". Which details, by school district,
          percentages of households experiencing different conditions that may
          affect remote learning. Below is a series of charts with that data
          broken up by county (parish, borough).
          <br><br>
          The counties with the highest rates of these conditions likely have
          many students who struggled educationally during the COVID-19 pandemic
          and likely require educational intervention and support to get back on
          track.

              <u>Households with Linguistically Isolated Children</u>
              <br><br>
              Linguistic Isolation is a term for limited English speaking
              households. Students in these households who have difficulty
              understanding remote instruction would likely not be able to
              overcome that difficulty with the help of non-English speaking
              adults in the home.

              Children with disabilities already experience educational setbacks
               in in-person learning environments. With the implementation of
               remote learning, these children likely no longer have access to
               the resources provided in an in-person school setting.

              <br><br>
              Children who do not have access to a computer or the internet at
              home will have had an incredibly difficult time with
              remote-learning. Even for school districts who were able to
              provide these resources to students in need, these students likely
              still lacked the computer literacy skills required to perform well
              in a remote-learning environment.

              Vulnerable jobs are those that pay low wages and do not provide

              <u>Households Living in Poverty</u>
              <br><br>
              Poverty is a large indicator of overall disadvantage that can
              affect educational success. Children living in poverty may be
              without the resources at home to facilitate remote learning and
              may also experience instability, such as food insecurity, as a
              result of not attending school in person. These factors can
              severely limit a child's ability to learn effectively.
