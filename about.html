          This was created by Kelly Ervin Mills as a final project for the MICA
          MPS Data Analytics and Visualization Program's Design Lab: The
          Industry Challenge course during the Summer 2023 semester.

        <h2 class="intro__dek">Inspiration & Goal</h2>
        <p class="intro__text">
          I live in an extremely under-resourced school district in rural
          Appalachia. In college, I volunteered at the local Head Start center
          and was struck by how much of a difference early educational
          intervention can make for children with varying disadvantages who are
          struggling to keep up with their peers. I wanted to expand that line
          of thinking into K-12 schools and create a piece that can draw
          attention to those who need it most.
          <br><br>
          In an interactive “scrollytelling”/visual essay format, I wanted
          locate and draw attention to school districts that likely have the
          most students who have fallen behind and are struggling educationally.
        </p>
        <h2 class="intro__dek">Audience</h2>
        <p class="intro__text">
         My primary audience is constituents in school districts with the most
         at-risk students. I believe this is useful for anyone interested in
         K-12 education in America. But, I am specifically targeting people
         living in the most affected school districts. I want the stark contrast
         between the highlighted districts and the rest of the country to hit
         home for those who call those places home. I hope that the realization
         that their communities are in need will compel members of my target
         audience to answer the call to action by contacting their
         representatives to advocate for funding for their local students.

        <p class="intro__text">The data fueling this project is The Urban
          Institute's "

            Household Conditions by Geographic School District
          </a>
           " dataset. From The Urban Institute: "This dataset describes the share of households within a
           geographic school district with conditions that may affect remote
           K–12 learning environments, such as linguistic isolation, crowded
           conditions, and access to a computer and broadband internet."

        <h2 class="intro__dek">Accessibility</h2>
        <p class="intro__text">
          While this project isn't 100% section 508 compliant, some design
          decisions were made with visual accessibility in mind. This project
          uses the
          <a href="https://opendyslexic.org/" target="_blank">
            Open Dyslexic
          </a>
          font throughout to increase readability. All charts use single-color
          scales that are equally visibly accessible to people with all types of
           color-blindness. The single-color scale is also less stimulating for
           some neurodivergent folks. Font and background color combinations all
           meet to WCAG AA contrast requirements.
          <br><br>
          Additional changes can, and should, be made to make this project
          accessible for a wider audience. Due to time limitations, all charts
          are static assets, including the callouts. However, all the callout
          text is duplicated in the scrolling text. The charts require detailed
          alt-text descriptions to make sense for screen readers. All efforts
          should be made to adjust the font/background color combinations to be
          WCAG AAA compliant instead of just AA.
